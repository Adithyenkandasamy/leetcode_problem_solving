    Function Definition (def)
        The function isPalindrome is defined as a method inside a class Solution.
        It takes an integer x as an input and returns a boolean (True or False).

    Conditional Statement (if)
        The function first checks if x is negative (if x < 0:).
        Since negative numbers have a - sign, they cannot be palindromes, so False is returned.

    Type Conversion (str(x))
        The integer x is converted to a string using str(x).
        This allows easy reversal and comparison of the number.

    String Slicing ([::-1])
        str(x)[::-1] reverses the string representation of x.
        [::-1] is Pythonâ€™s slicing technique to reverse a string.

    Comparison (==)
        The function checks whether str(x) (original number) is equal to str(x)[::-1] (reversed number).
        If they match, True is returned (indicating x is a palindrome), otherwise, False.

    Return Statement (return)
        The function finally returns True or False based on the comparison result.
