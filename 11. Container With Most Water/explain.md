The two-pointer technique is used in this algorithm to traverse the list from both ends.

1. Initialize two pointers, one at the start of the list and one at the end, and a variable `max_area` to store the maximum area calculated so far.

2. Calculate the area between the two pointers by multiplying the distance between them by the height of the smaller bar. Update `max_area` if this area is greater than the current `max_area`.

3. Move the pointer with the smaller bar towards the other pointer. This is because the area is determined by the smaller bar, and moving the other pointer would not increase the area.

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the two pointers meet, at which point we have calculated the maximum area.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the two pointers and the `max_area`.
